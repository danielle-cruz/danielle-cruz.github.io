                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    Whether it's a tender moment in a rom-com movie or a jump scare in a horror film, sound plays an integral role in a viewer's experience. Even beyond the soundtrack of a movie are other details like background music and environmental sounds which provide context and emotion that may go unnoticed to those who can’t hear that information. SoundSight is a visualization engine to create better representations of such sounds in video content for Deaf and Hard of Hearing users.

                    While closed captioning is great for encapsulating dialogue in a video, it doesn't capture everything. After interviewing a number of people who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing, we found that semantic and emotive information which informs video content can often get lost in closed captioning. As Christine Sun Kim explains, a mournful violin playing in the background of a scene can often get reduced to something like “[music],” lacking emotional and informative depth <a href="https://youtu.be/tfe479qL8hg">("Artist Christine Sun Kim Rewrites Closed Captions")</a>.

                        <p>
                            Using the insights we gathered from our needfinding interviews, we developed the idea of creating a sound visualizer which maps different sonic parameters to visual parameters.
                            These visualizations would capture sounds like music and environmental noises which aren't typically conveyed by closed captioning and would overlay on the video to supplement (not replace) closed captions.

                <h3>User-Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    To better understand which of these variables might prove helpful or prove too distracting, we conducted 2 rounds of prototyping and user-testing with both Deaf and Hard of Hearing users. 
                </p>
                
                <h4>Key Design Questions</h4>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the most important sounds to convey? (music, voice, environmental noise)</li>
                        <li>What are the most important aspects of the sound to communicate? (rhythm, intensity, frequency, emotion, location — i.e., does the sound originate from an action on the left or right of the screen)</li>
                        <li>What is the best strategy to communicate those various aspects? (color, thickness, opacity, noise, smoothness, position on screen)</li>
                        <li>How might we maximize information and aesthetic enjoyment while minimizing distraction?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Methodology</h4>
                <p>
                    To conduct these user tests, we created 3 different visualizers for 3 different movie clips. Participants were asked to watch each clip and then respond to a few qualitative questions measuring clarity, understanding, aesthetics, and level of distraction for each clip.

                    <ul>
                        <li>What's happening in the clip? How can you tell?</li>
                        <li>What's the mood of the scene? How can you tell?</li>
                        <li>How did the visualization impact your viewing of the scene?</li>
                        <li>What was effective or ineffective about the visualization?</li>

This allows users to make more informed decisions about their learning, saving them from potential discouragement from trying to tackle a far too difficult text.

Users found this distinct voice visualizer distracting, as the closed captions were already there. They expressed preference to watching the speaker’s mouth and facial expressions instead.

                <p>Given the limited scope of our user-testing, next steps include conducting more widely-tested surveys with more controlled and finer-tuned visualization prototypes. We'd also like to explore the option of leaving more room for aesthetic customization with regard to color, thickness, screen position, etc.</p>
