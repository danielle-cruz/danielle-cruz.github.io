                    Buildagram is a construction set that empowers learners to make their ideas concrete by exploring mathematical shapes and relations. Designed with Adelmo Eloy and Kavindya Thennakoon, under the guidance of Wayne Grant from the Learning Design Technology Program at the Stanford Graduate School of Education.

                    A foundational skill in mathematics education, spatial reasoning describes the cognitive processes that enable learners to navigate between two- and three-dimensional perspectives. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geometry concepts like spatial reasoning are an integral part of mathematics education starting as early as in first grade <a href="http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/G/">(Common Core)</a>. However, math is rarely thought of as hands-on or play-oriented amongst young children; traditional approaches to developing spatial reasoning skills have often contributed to a view of geometry and creativity as mutually exclusive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How might we bridge the gap between the two for kids like Anna?

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the tangram puzzle, we designed Buildagram, a laser-cut construction kit made of acrylic that combines the creativity of free play with the structure of geometry.
